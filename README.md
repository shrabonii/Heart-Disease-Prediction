# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Implemented Different machine learning approaches to predict heart disease. 

In this project, the dataset[1] dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes.

The aim of this project is to analyse the data with information about several diseases and by analysing those data predicting the possiblity of person being attacked by heart disease based on other disease information. For this project , machine learning algorithms like decision tree classifier and logistics regression has been used.

After training the model finally predicted the result as possiblity of being attacked by heart disease .
