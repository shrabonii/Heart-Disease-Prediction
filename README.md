# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Implemented Different machine learning approaches to predict heart disease. 

In this project, the dataset[1] dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes.

The aim of this project is to analyse the data from the dataset[1] , where 13 attributes has been extracted for analysis. Some of the attributes are patient's age, body compounds like serum cholestoral,  blood sugar and others like resting blood pressure quantity etc. For this project, Decision Tree Classifier and Logistic Regression algorithms has been used. 

After training the model finally predicted the result as possibility of being attacked by heart disease .
