# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Implemented Different machine learning approaches to predict heart disease. 

In this project, the dataset This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes.

The aim of this project is to analyse those data and find out which disease affected people are more prone to be affected by covid-19. To do this, Logistic Regression has been used because it is a binary classification problem. As in this project, it's been tested whether a person is more susceptible to be covid 19 positive or negative based on existing attributes, logistic regression is a good fit for the problem. Because, Logistic regression is a method used for binary classification tasks, as it models the probability of the outcome variable (in this case, the probability of being COVID-positive) as a function of the predictor variables (in this case, the underlying health conditions). Logistic regression is also known for its simplicity, interpretability, and ability to handle both numerical and categorical input features [2].

After training the model finally predicted the result.
